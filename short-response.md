# Short Response Questions

1. - If I am collaborating with a classmate, the first thing that each of the team members need to do is: The person who made the repo needs to go to settings, collaborators, and type their team member's gmail to send an invite. And the team member, who got sent the invite, needs to check their gmail and accept the invite to be a collaborator.

- It is important to do this step because that is how you merge both team members branches later on. They have to be working in the same repo, so they can combine their different branches after.

2. Developers use branches because it allows them to make or test changes to their project without affecting the main branch. Branches help reduce the risk of messing up the main branch.

3. Git is a distributed version control system where every dev has access to all changes, and they can use it to see what their code looks like currently. Github is a cloud based service that allows developers to store, track, manage, and control changes to their code. Git and github works together by making it easier for developers to code. For example, the GUI and features are simple to use and user-friendly.

4. git commit -m "saving work"
   git add . 
   git push

This command sequence is wrong because git commit -m "" comes before git add .
git add . is supposed to be the first command when saving work.
The correct command sequence should be:
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
